# Open Banking Getting Started Angular

This sample application shows how to get started with the Certua Web Components for Open Banking. For more information please refer to our [developer documentation](https://www.certua.io/developers-beta)

## How to get started

1. Run `yarn`
2. Update the institution selection component successUrl and failureUrl to be publicly accessible urls ([Ngrok](https://ngrok.com) is a good tool for this).
3. run `yarn start`

Once the application is running you can use your Certua security credentials to get a token and see the components working.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.0.
